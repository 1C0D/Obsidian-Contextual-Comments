# Contextual Comments

- Toggle comments in code blocks (depending on the language) by selecting text you want to comment.
- Comment the whole line at cursor position without selection.
- Improved handling of normal comments (`%%...%%`)
- Two commands to trim end lines: one for the whole document, and one for code blocks only.

(If you need more code block prefixes, feel free to ask on my GitHub. If I missed some, please let me know.)
