# Contextual Comments(the Original ^^: 100% effective, and super fast)

(Adviced shortcuts <kbd>ctrl :</kbd> for Line(s) comment, <kbd>shit alt a</kbd> for Block comment)

- Improved handling of normal comments `%%...%%`

- in code blocks (language related):  
  - **respect indentation**
  - selection multiline → starts and ends at cursor position
  - if no selection → whole line at cursor position
  - the block comment works on selections around `/* ... */` or `<!-- ... -->`

- Two commands to trim end lines: 
  - one for the whole document,     
  - one in code blocks only (the most useful).

comments in dataview js supported.
